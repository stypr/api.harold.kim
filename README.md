# api.harold.kim

It's just the backend API server for harold.kim and its subdomains

Some part of sourcecodes interacting with with private API services are not included within this repository.

It's intentionally left to load data everytime as to ensure that it gets refreshed as soon as possible.

There are cache problems so I'm skipping other sorts of methods that minimizes the load of this process.
